    GRAPH
        * A graph data structure consists of a finite (and possibly mutable) set of VERTICES (NODES/POINTS),
            together with a set of UNORDERED PAIRS of these vertices for an undirected graph or a set of ORDERED
            PAIRS for a directed graph.
    
    USES FOR GRAPHS:
        * Social Networks (connections between friends)
        * Location / Mapping
        * Routing Algorithms
        * Visual Hierarchy
        * File System Optimizations
        * Recommendations (movies, music, games)
        * EVERYWHERE!
    
    ESSENTIAL GRAPH TERMS
        * Vertex - a node
        * Edge - connection between nodes
        * Weighted/Unweighted - values assigned to distances between vertices
        * Directed/Undirected - directions assigned to distanced between vertices

    WAYS OF STORING GRAPHS
        * ADJACENCY matrix - stroing conncetions between the vertices in a matrix
               A  B  C  D  E
            A  0  1  0  0  1
            B  1  0  1  0  0
            C  0  1  0  1  0
            D  0  0  1  0  1
            E  1  0  0  1  0
        * ADJACENCY list - storing connections in an array or a list
               [              {
        0:      [1, 5],        A: [B, F],
        1:      [0, 2],        B: [A, C],   
        2:      [1, 3],        C: [B, D],
        3:      [2, 4],        D: [C, E],
        4:      [3, 5],        E: [D, F],
        5:      [4, 0]         F: [E, A],
               ]               }

    ADJACENCY MATRIX vs. ADJACENCY LIST - BIG O
        V - number of vertices  E - number of edges 

        *                   AL              AM
        * ADD VERTEX        O(1)            O(V^2)
        * ADD EDGE          O(1)            O(1)
        * REMOVE VERTEX     O(V+E)          O(V^2)
        * REMOVE EDGE       O(E)            O(1)
        * QUERY             O(V+E)          O(1)
        * STORAGE           O(V+E)          O(V^2)
        
        * ADJACENCY LIST
            - Can take up less space (in sparse graphs)
            - Faster to iterate over all edges
            - Can be slower to lookup specific edge
        * ADJACENCY MATRIX
            - Takes up more space (in sparse graphs)
            - Slower to iterate over all edges
            - Faster to lookup specific edge

    GRAPH TRAVERSAL USES
        * Peer to peer networking
        * Web crawlers
        * Finding "closest" matches/recommendations
        * Shortest path problems
            - GPS Navigation
            - Solving mazes
            - AI (shortest path to win the game)

    DEPTH-FIRST TRAVERSAL
        * Explore as far as possible down one branch before "backtracking"

    BREADTH-FIRST TRAVERSAL
        * Visit neighbors at current depth first!
