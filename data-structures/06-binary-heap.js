/*
    BINARY HEAP
        * Very similar to a binary search tree, but with some different rules!
        * In a MaxBinaryHeap, parent nodes are always larger than child nodes.
        * In a MinBinaryHeap, parent nodes are always smaller than child nodes
          * Binary Heaps are used to implement Priority Queues, which are very commonly used data structures
          * They are also used quite a bit, with graph traversal algorithms
    
    MAX BINARY HEAP:
        * Each parent has at most two child nodes
        * The value of each parent node is ALWAYS greater than its child nodes
        * In a max Binary Heap the parent is greater than the children, but there are no guarantees between sibling nodes.
        * A binary heap is as compact as possible. All the children of each node are as full
            as they can be and left children are filled out first
    
    HEAP BASED ON ARRAY
             100
          39     82
        23  22  35 72

        * => [100, 39, 82, 23, 22, 35, 72]
        * To find children of a node:
            - Left: 2n + 1
            - Right: 2n + 2
        * To find a parent of a node: Math.floor((n - 1)/2)


    BIG O:
        * Insertion - O(log n) (only compare once per a level)
        * Searching - O(log n)
        * Search - O(n) (not needed in BH - BH is not made for search)
